# Scramblies challenge

### Task 1

Complete the function (scramble str1 str2) that returns true if a portion of str1 characters can be rearranged to match str2, otherwise returns false

##### Notes:

•	Only lower case letters will be used (a-z). No punctuation or digits will be included.

•	Performance needs to be considered

##### Examples:
1.	(scramble? “rekqodlw” ”world”) ==> true
2.	(scramble? “cedewaraaossoqqyt” ”codewars”) ==> true
3.	(scramble? “katas”  “steak”) ==> false

### Task 2

Create a web service that accepts two strings in a request and applies function scramble? from previous task to them.

### Task 3

Create a UI in ClojureScript with two inputs for strings and a scramble button. When the button is fired it should call the API from previous task and display a result.

#### Notes

Please pay attention to tests, code readability and error cases.
